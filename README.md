# Threadwise

Threadwise is an app you can self-host to serve as your helpful coworker who proactively takes initiative on long slack threads. It helps summarize long threads so you don't have to, pulls out action items, detects unresolved conversations, and gently follows up with folks in the thread when a resolution has not been met.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Slack bot with permissions: `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `reactions:write`, `users:read`
2. OpenAI API Key or other LLM provider
3. Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Slack and LLM credentials
```

### Running the Application

**Development Mode:**

```bash
# Run API server only
npm run dev

# Run cron scheduler only (in a separate terminal)
npm run dev:cron

# Run both API server and cron together
npm run dev:all
```

**Production Mode:**

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Run API server
npm start

# Run cron scheduler (in a separate process)
npm run start:cron
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Deployment mode
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=single  # or 'multi' for multi-workspace

# Single workspace mode
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C1234567890

# Multi-workspace mode (for future)
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# LLM Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key

# Server configuration
PORT=3000
HOST=localhost

# Cron configuration
CRON_SCHEDULE="*/15 * * * *"  # Every 15 minutes
RUN_ON_START=true  # Run analysis immediately on startup

# Execution Mode
EXECUTION_MODE=in-memory  # or 'kubernetes' for K8s jobs

# Kubernetes Configuration (only needed if EXECUTION_MODE=kubernetes)
K8S_NAMESPACE=default
K8S_IMAGE_NAME=your-registry/threadwise
K8S_IMAGE_TAG=latest
K8S_SECRET_NAME=threadwise-secrets
K8S_TTL_SECONDS=3600
K8S_BACKOFF_LIMIT=3
K8S_MEMORY_REQUEST=256Mi
K8S_CPU_REQUEST=100m
K8S_MEMORY_LIMIT=512Mi
K8S_CPU_LIMIT=500m
```

### API Endpoints

Once the server is running, you can access:

- **Health Check**: `GET http://localhost:3000/health`
- **Analyze Workspace**: `POST http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces/:workspaceId/analyze`

### Testing

**Manual API Testing:**

```bash
# Test the API manually
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Trigger analysis for a workspace
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces/default/analyze
```

**Automated Tests:**

```bash
# Start the API server first
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test workspaceAnalyzer.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for more testing details.

## Execution Modes

Threadwise supports two execution modes for workspace analysis:

### 1. In-Memory Mode (Default)

Direct API calls from the cron orchestrator to the API server. Best for:

- Development and testing
- Small number of workspaces (<50)
- Simple infrastructure requirements
- Faster execution

```bash
EXECUTION_MODE=in-memory
```

### 2. Kubernetes Jobs Mode

Each workspace analysis runs as an isolated Kubernetes job. Best for:

- Production deployments with many workspaces
- Need for resource isolation per workspace
- Horizontal scaling across K8s cluster
- Fault isolation (one workspace failure doesn't affect others)

```bash
EXECUTION_MODE=kubernetes
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
- kubectl configured
- Docker registry for your images

### Step 1: Build and Push Docker Image

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

```bash
# Build and push
docker build -t your-registry/threadwise:latest .
docker push your-registry/threadwise:latest
```

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes Secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic threadwise-secrets \
  --from-literal=llm-api-key=your-openai-key \
  --from-literal=llm-provider=openai \
  --from-literal=llm-model=gpt-4o-mini \
  --namespace=default
```

### Step 3: Deploy API Server

```yaml
# k8s/api-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: threadwise-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: threadwise
      component: api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: threadwise
        component: api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api
          image: your-registry/threadwise:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: DEPLOYMENT_MODE
              value: "single"
            - name: EXECUTION_MODE
              value: "kubernetes"
            - name: K8S_NAMESPACE
              value: "default"
            - name: K8S_IMAGE_NAME
              value: "your-registry/threadwise"
            - name: K8S_IMAGE_TAG
              value: "latest"
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: threadwise-secrets
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: threadwise-api
spec:
  selector:
    app: threadwise
    component: api
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
```

### Step 4: Deploy Cron Orchestrator

```yaml
# k8s/cron-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: threadwise-cron
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: threadwise
      component: cron
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: threadwise
        component: cron
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cron
          image: your-registry/threadwise:latest
          command: ["node", "dist/jobs/cronOrchestrator.js"]
          env:
            - name: EXECUTION_MODE
              value: "kubernetes"
            - name: API_URL
              value: "http://threadwise-api.default.svc.cluster.local:3000"
            - name: CRON_SCHEDULE
              value: "*/15 * * * *"
```

### Step 5: Grant RBAC Permissions

The cron orchestrator needs permissions to create K8s jobs:

```yaml
# k8s/rbac.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: threadwise-cron
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: threadwise-job-manager
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["batch"]
    resources: ["jobs"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "delete"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: threadwise-job-manager
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: threadwise-job-manager
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: threadwise-cron
```

Update the cron deployment to use the service account:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: threadwise-cron
      containers:
      # ... rest of config
```

### Deploy Everything

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### Switching Between Modes

Simply change the `EXECUTION_MODE` environment variable:

```bash
# Switch to in-memory
kubectl set env deployment/threadwise-cron EXECUTION_MODE=in-memory

# Switch to kubernetes
kubectl set env deployment/threadwise-cron EXECUTION_MODE=kubernetes
```

No code changes required!

## Overview of Main Objectives

1. Slack Thread Summarizer / Resolution Detector (Phase 1)
   What it does:
   Watches long Slack threads in real-time.
   Summarizes the discussion (key points, decisions made, blockers).
   Detects whether the thread ended with consensus or unresolved issues.
   Optionally, posts a “TL;DR” summary at the end or sends a daily digest of unresolved threads.

Agent angle:
One agent can gather messages, another can generate the summary, a third can classify resolution status.

2. Action Item Extractor (Phase 3)
   What it does:
   Pulls out tasks, owners, and deadlines mentioned in threads.
   Creates a mini “to-do list” for each thread.
   Could integrate with Jira, Notion, or Google Tasks.

3. Auto Follow-Up Reminder Agent (TBD)
   What it does:
   Detects threads where questions were asked but not answered.
   Sends a gentle Slack reminder to the relevant person.
   Tracks which threads still need attention.
