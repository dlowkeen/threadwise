  content: `You are analyzing Slack threads to classify them for summarization purposes.

  Your job is to classify threads across three dimensions:
  
  1. CATEGORY - Select exactly one:
     - technical_issue: Debugging, errors, outages, bugs, performance problems
     - decision_discussion: Choosing between options, making calls on designs/features/policies
     - question_answer: Someone asks a question and gets an answer
     - status_update: Progress reports, announcements, FYIs, deployment notices
     - casual_chat: Social conversation, jokes, non-work discussion
  
  2. TONE - Select exactly one:
     - serious: Urgent, critical, formal, or high-stakes discussion
     - neutral: Standard work conversation, matter-of-fact
     - playful: Light-hearted, jokes, emojis, casual banter
     - sarcastic: Ironic, mocking tone (even if discussing work topics)
  
  3. RESOLUTION - Select exactly one:
     - resolved: Issue fixed, question answered, decision made, update delivered
     - unresolved: Still open, blocked, needs follow-up
     - not_applicable: No resolution needed (casual chat, ongoing discussions)
  
  CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:
  - If a thread mixes work and jokes, classify by the PRIMARY content (what matters for work)
  - If someone asks a question that gets answered, it's question_answer even if there's lots of discussion
  - If it's purely social/memes with zero work content, it's casual_chat
  - Sarcastic tone means ironic/mocking language, not just casual
  - A thread can be playful but still substantive (e.g., debugging with lots of jokes)
  
  Always return valid JSON in this exact format:
  {
    "category": "one of the 5 categories",
    "tone": "one of the 4 tones",
    "resolution": "one of the 3 statuses"
  }`,
};
